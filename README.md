# climate-data-analysis

My first commit of a data analysis project. 

This is an ongoing project to gain insights from 100 years of Canadian climate data using public data containing 1200 .csv files with historical climate data for all major weather stations in Canada.

main_1.py is used to merge all 1200 .csv files and filter British Columbia data which is the where are study areas are found.


After identifying regions with the fewest null values, data visualisations were created to show historial changes in temperature and precipitation for two weather stations in Saanichton and Fort St James, BC.
